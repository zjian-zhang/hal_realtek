Important Information About This Repository
*******************************************

HAL Realtek (or `hal_realtek`) is a collection of tools, low-level APIs, and hardware access functions for Realtek Devices.

This repository is a copy (not a fork) of the [ameba-rtos repository](https://github.com/Ameba-AIoT/ameba-rtos) that contains Ameba SoCs.

After following the standard Zephyr guide for compilation, both app and bootloader images tailored for Ameba SoCs will be generated. [Refer to this tutorial](https://github.com/Ameba-AIoT/ameba-rtos/) for Flashing these images and running on Ameba SoCs.
